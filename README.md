# ML_LinearRegression
Machine Learning linear regression algorithm


Using PIP should be installed next libraries:

pip install scikit-learn
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn


Also I used Anaconda IDE with Jupyter local server
Instead may be used Google Colab 


Mean Absolute Error

Mean absolute error (MAE) is calculated by taking the average of absolute error obtained by subtracting the real values from predicted values.


Mean Squared Error

Mean squared error (MSE) is similar to MAE. However, error for each record is squared in the case of MSE in order to punish the data record with a huge difference between the predicted and actual values.

Root Mean Squared Error

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is simply the under root of mean squared error
